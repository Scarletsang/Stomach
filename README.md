# Stomach

A Simple library that provides a simple setup for a recursive descent parser. Now, you should be able to write a parser that can digest any string that you received. The library is aimed to be transparent of what it is doing but having a simple design with little abstraction. The memory layout of the whole parser is the definition of the `struct Stomach`.
